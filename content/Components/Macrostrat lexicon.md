Macrostrat maintains a lexicon of geologic information, such as stratigraphic units, etc.

## Concepts

- Lithologies (e.g., sandstone)
- Lithology attributes (e.g., _hummocky cross-stratified_)
- Environmental interpretations
- Stratigraphic names

## Mechanics

- This lexicon integrates curated information from a variety of publishers
    - Notably the USGS Stratigraphic Names lexicon
    - Also lexicons from other organizations
- Linked to from map and column descriptive information (mostly using autogenerated scripts)
- The capability to manage geologic names and concepts is not unique but the tools on top of it are
