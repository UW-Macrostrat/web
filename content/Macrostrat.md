Macrostrat is a geological model of the Earth's crust and its stratigraphic
framework. It is currently developed at the eponymous lab at University of Wisconsinâ€“Madison, by a team of geologists
and software engineers.

The Macrostrat data platform underlies [Rockd](https://rockd.org/), a mobile
application that allows users to explore the geology of the world around them.

The documentation is open-source, and we encourage contributions. Please
