- A vision to create a new version of Macrostrat with a community-contribution
  model.
- Macrostrat v1 effectively harnessed geologic data, but Macrostrat v2 seeks to
  harness the community
- Vision first described in a GSA talk in 2021

The first round of funding to support initial development along these lines was
secured in summer 2023 by [[Daven Quinn]]
