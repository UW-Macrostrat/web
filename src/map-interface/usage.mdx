## Using Macrostrat's map interface

Macrostrat's map interface is the primary tool to interact with our geologic map holdings.

### Globe projection <NewSwatch>New in version 4.0!</NewSwatch>

<DocsVideo slug="map-globe-demo" />

The map interface is now based on an orthographic (globe) projection at low zoom levels. This display
is intuitive and accurate, but it cannot show all continents at once. To switch back to a mercator projection,
click the <Icon icon="map" size={16}></Icon> button in the bottom right
of the map interface.

### 3D view <NewSwatch>New in version 4.0!</NewSwatch>

<DocsVideo slug="map-3d-demo" />

When zoomed to a localized area, the map can be rotated to 3D by pressing the '3D'
button that appears in the bottom right corner of the map. Drag while right-clicking
the mouse to adjust the view orientation. Click the compass at
the bottom right corner to return to a north-up, overhead view.

### Map filters

<DocsVideo slug="map-filtering-demo" />

The map can be searched and filtered by geologic criteria
including formation names, lithology types, and time intervals.

### Primary literature

<DocsVideo slug="map-literature-demo" />

The [xDD](https://www.xdd.org) machine-reading system provides links to
papers relevant to specific units and map areas.

### Linked map + stratigraphic legend

<DocsVideo slug="map-infobox-demo" />

Clicking the map reports location-specific data sourced from
geologic maps and stratigraphic columns.

### Geologic layers

<DocsVideo slug="map-layers-demo" />

Additional layers such as Macrostrat columns,
[PBDB](https://paleobiodb.org) fossil collections, and satellite imagery
can be overlaid on the geologic map.

### Elevation profile

<DocsVideo slug="map-elevation-profile-demo" />

In <em>Elevation profile</em> mode, click two points on the map to create
an elevation profile between them. This capability is a placeholder
for in-development 3D cross-section functionality.

### Fossil collections

<DocsVideo slug="map-fossils-demo" />

Detailed information about [PBDB](https://paleobiodb.org) fossil
collections can be found in the info panel.
