The Macrostrat ingestion process is built to enable the registration, processing and distribution of new maps.

## Staging

### Registering a Map for Ingestion

Registration involves uploading all relevant files to an S3 bucket and
recording them in Macrostrat's database via the API. Once a map has been
registered, its progress through the ingestion process can be tracked.

### Preprocessing

After a map has been registered, the internal map processing pipeline can
prepare the map for harmonization. This step involves determining the format
of the map's data (e.g., Shapefiles, Geopackage, or TA1 output); parsing it
into its component parts; and pulling out the points, lines, and polygons.

### In Progress

We are currently working on adding subcommands to the `macrostrat`
command-line interface for taking a collection of files for a map and
processing them through the staging process outlines above. Briefly:

1. Install the `macrostrat` command by following the instructions in the
   [UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat](https://github.com/UW-Macrostrat/macrostrat)
   GitHub repository.

2. Run `macrostrat maps run-pipeline --help` for an overview of how to
   stage a map.

We are also currently working to make the registration of a map more available via the web interface. In progress are the
creation of API routes that will allow a user to provide the map files directly via the ingestion interface and have the
automated pipelines that are currently in place translate this map into a new candidate in the Macrostrat system.

## Integration

### Harmonization

This process is what allows Macrostrat to present heterogenous maps in a homogenized map interface. Using the data that
is processed into our points, lines and polygon tables in the previous step we can begin to assign them with our curated
set of geological properties. As you go through this process Macrostrat will continuously ( in progress ) update this maps
tiles and associated metadata APIs. This allows you to continuously improve this map as new information comes in.

[How to use this interface](/docs/ingestion/harmonization)

### Prioritization

After the harmonization process is deemed complete a expert will review the resulting map. Checking for novelty in the existing
system and quality of ingestion they will decide whether to integrate this map into Macrostrat's Carto dataset that powers
its main interface.

__Note__: A map does not need to be integrated into the Carto dataset for its information/tiles to be exposed via API.
Prioritization is a optional step that maps might not reach.
