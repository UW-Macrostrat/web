# Concept apps

## Stratigraphic columns

Macrostrat is working to push stratigraphic columns into the digital age.
We have developed a number of applications that explore the potential
user interface design elements around digital stratigraphic columns.

- [Carbon isotopes](/dev/concepts/carbon-isotopes)
- [Detrital zircon](/dev/concepts/detrital-zircon)
- [Age model](/dev/concepts/eODP)
- [Multiscale demo](/dev/concepts/multiscale-figure)
- [Column editor](/dev/concepts/editor)

## Paleogeography

- [PaleobioDB](/dev/concepts/paleogeography/pbdb)
- [Macrostrat measurements](/dev/concepts/paleogeography/measurements)
