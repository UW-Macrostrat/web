This is the homepage of Macrostrat's geological lexicons, which are
assembled from many data sources including Canada's [WebLex](https://weblex.canada.ca/weblexnet4/weblex_e.aspx),
the USGS's [Geolex](https://ngmdb.usgs.gov/Geolex/search), and other
sources. The lexicon is continually updated in partnership with
researchers and data providers.

**[Sift](/sift)**, Macrostrat's legacy lexicon app, is still available for use
as it is gradually brought into this new framework.
